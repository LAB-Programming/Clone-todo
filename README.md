#Clone todo

---

###Description:
A todo application for CloneOS with a powerful wildcard ability.
This program is good for reminders that happen over a longer peroid
of time but occur by some pattern. For example getting a reminder to
pay rent the third of every month.

####Wildcards:
Year, month, day, hour, or minute can all be designated as a
"wildcard" which means that that field can have any value.
